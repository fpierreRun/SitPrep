        By creating an account, you grant to SitPrep a worldwide, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free right and license to host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, translate, modify, and distribute Your Content, including any information you authorize us to access from Facebook or other third-party source (if applicable), in whole or in part, and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the future.

    8. PURCHASES AND AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SUBSCRIPTIONS

  </div>
  <div class="card-body">
      <!-- Insert the content for the Privacy Policy here. e.g., -->
      
      <p>
        SitPrep may offer products and services for purchase through iTunes, the App Store, Google Play or other external services authorized by SitPrep (each, an “External Service,” and any purchases made thereon, an “External Service Purchase”). SitPrep may also offer products and services for purchase via credit card or other payment processors on the Website or inside the App (“Internal Purchases”). If you purchase a subscription, it will automatically renew until you cancel, in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase, as further described below. If you cancel your subscription, you will continue to have access to your subscription benefits until the end of your subscription period, at which point it will expire. 
        <br><br> <strong>8a. EXTERNAL SERVICE PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong><br> 
        When making a purchase on the Service, you may have the option to pay through an External Service, such as with your Apple ID or Google account (“your External Service Account”), and your External Service Account will be charged for the purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase and the general terms applicable to your External Service Account. Some External Services may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live, which may change from time to time. 
        <br><br>If your External Service Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, your External Service Account will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, the subscription will automatically continue for the price and time period you agreed to when subscribing. 
        <br><br>To cancel a subscription: If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you must log in to your External Service Account and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the App from your device. For example, if you subscribed using your Apple ID, cancellation is handled by Apple, not SitPrep. To cancel a purchase made with your Apple ID, go to Settings > [click on your Apple ID] > Subscriptions, then find your SitPrep subscription and follow the instructions to cancel. You can also request assistance at https://getsupport.apple.com. Similarly, if you subscribed on Google Play, cancellation is handled by Google. To cancel a purchase made through Google Play, launch the Google Play app on your mobile device and go to Menu > My Apps > Subscriptions, then find your SitPrep subscription and follow the instructions to cancel.

        <br><br>If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your External Service Account, SitPrep may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion, on the basis that you have determined that you do not want a SitPrep subscription. In the event that your chargeback or other payment reversal is overturned, please contact SitPrep at INSERT CUSTOMER SERVICE EMAIL.

        <br><br><strong>8b. INTERNAL PURCHASES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong><br> 
        If you make an Internal Purchase, you agree to pay the prices displayed to you for the Services you’ve selected as well as any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed on your payments (and as may change from time to time), and you authorize SitPrep to charge the payment method you provide (your “Payment Method”). SitPrep may correct any billing errors or mistakes even if we have already requested or received payment. If you initiate a chargeback or otherwise reverse a payment made with your Payment Method, SitPrep may terminate your account immediately in its sole discretion, on the basis that you have determined that you do not want a SitPrep subscription. In the event that your chargeback or other payment reversal is overturned, please contact SitPrep at INSERT CUSTOMER SERVICE EMAIL.
        <br><br>If your Internal Purchase includes an automatically renewing subscription, your Payment Method will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for the price and time period you agreed to when subscribing, until you cancel. 
        <br><br> To cancel a subscription, log in to the Website. If you cancel a subscription, you may continue to use the cancelled service until the end of your then-current subscription term. The subscription will not be renewed when your then-current term expires.
        <br><br>You may edit your Payment Method information by logging into the Website. If a payment is not successfully processed, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. 
        <br><br> In addition, you authorize us to obtain updated or replacement expiration dates and card numbers for your credit or debit card as provided by your credit or debit card issuer. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer, or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. Certain users may be entitled to request a refund. See Section 8c below for more information.
        <br><br><strong>8c. REFUNDS</strong><br> 
        Generally, all purchases are final and nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, except if the laws applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds.

      <p>
          If you are dissatisfied with our Services for any reason, please contact SitPrep Customer Service first so that we can try to resolve your concerns without the need of outside assistance. If you choose to pursue a claim against SitPrep, these terms will apply.
      </p>
      
      <h4>14a. ARBITRATION, CLASS-ACTION WAIVER, AND JURY WAIVER</h4>
      <p>
          The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof) or our Services shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by INSERT ARBITRATION COMPANY HERE under the ARBITRATION COMPANY’S Rules & Procedures. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that either party has the right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims court if the party’s claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims court.
      </p>
      <p>
          If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be administratively closed, and if requested after the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine if the dispute should be decided in arbitration or if the arbitration should be administratively closed and decided in small claims court. Whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
          By using our Services in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY, and the arbitrator shall determine all issues regarding the arbitrability of the dispute. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
          Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in Salt Lake County, Utah or Utah County Utah. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
      </p>

      <h4>14b. GOVERNING LAW</h4>
      <p>
          Except where our arbitration agreement is prohibited by law, the laws of Utah, U.S.A., excluding Utah’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or our Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement in Section 14a above shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the choice of Utah governing law shall not supersede any mandatory consumer protection legislation in such jurisdictions.
      </p>

      <h4>14c. VENUE</h4>
      <p>
          Except for claims that may be properly brought in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction in the county or other jurisdiction in which you reside or in Salt Lake County, Utah or Utah County Utah, all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, to our Services, or to your relationship with SitPrep that for whatever reason are not submitted to arbitration will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Salt Lake County, Utah, U.S.A., or Utah County Utah, U.S.A. You and SitPrep consent to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of courts in the State of Utah and waive any claim that such courts constitute an inconvenient forum.

The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that your SitPrep account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your account and its content terminate upon your death, unless otherwise provided by law. Any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us without restriction. No agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary or other special relationship or employment is created as a result of these Terms, and you may not make any representations on behalf of or bind SitPrep in any manner.
