                        <h4>WHY PREPARE NOW
                        </h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">One thing that 2020 has taught us is that you never really know what can happen. One moment everything seems fine. The next moment, the supermarket shelves are empty and we’re being told to stay indoors and social distance. This year has been the perfect illustration of why individuals need to make sure that they are prepared for an emergency. With that in mind, let’s take a look at the benefits of this in further detail.
                        </p>

                        <h4>THE NEED TO BE PREPARED IS VERY REAL 

                        </h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">There is only one place to begin when it comes to emergency preparedness, and this is the fact that being prepared is something that is very important and very real. We all like to have that “it won’t happen to me” attitude. However, 2020 has shown that no one is safe when it comes to world disasters. In fact, disasters disrupt hundreds of thousands of lives on a yearly basis. It’s not just about COVID-19. We have seen everything from hurricanes to explosions cause devastation in recent times.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">If a disaster happens in your local area, disaster-relief organizations, local government, and the community will try to help you. However, these organizations are often overwhelmed during these moments, and so you need to be prepared yourself. At the minimum, you need to ensure that you have an emergency kit with food so that you can survive during these difficult scenarios. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">You also need to make sure that you know how to respond should a specific type of disaster happen in your area, whether this is terrorism, flooding, extreme cold, an earthquake, or a hurricane. You need to know how to be self-sufficient for as long as possible. This can mean providing your own sanitation, water, food, first aid, and shelter.
                        </p>

                        <h4>THERE ARE CLEAR BENEFITS THAT COME WITH BEING PREPARED
                        </h4>

                        <p class="text-muted">Not only do we have to accept the fact that the chance of a disaster happening is very real, but there are clear benefits to gain from being prepared as well. This can help to lower the losses, anxiety, and fear that arise when there is a disaster.
                    </p>
                        <p class="text-muted" >You can also lower the impact of a disaster by being prepared, for example, by elevating a property or floodproofing it, or securing items that could become loose should there be an earthquake. By addressing the potential for a disaster before it happens, you can make sure that the impact is minimized as much as possible so that this does not have such a massive effect on the rest of your life.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">So there you have it: everything you need to know about emergency preparedness and why it is critical for individuals to take this seriously. The need to be prepared is very real, and there are clearly some key advantages associated with this, so don’t overlook it!
